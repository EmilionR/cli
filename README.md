# My git test website

Welcome! This was a project I made following a lesson at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net). The goal of this was to get used to working with git and GitHub, especially using the command lines in the terminal.

The principles of proper version control were a key focal point, in addition to the git commands themselves. Also, we're learning proper markdown for the readme file and how important this, along with proper commit messages, really is.

Having made this repo, I now feel confident about these matters.
